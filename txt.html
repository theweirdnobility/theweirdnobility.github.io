FADE IN:
INT. James’ attic - day, 1925
JAMES sits at the desk writing a note.  Snow falls outside the window. He writes:
        The Orchard,                                  
        Where We Are Gods,                          
        Exists Because                        
        We Say It So Exists.                     
              — The Weird Nobility
He slams the quill on the desk, folds the letter, and sticks it in an envelope. He seals the letter with a wax seal. He puts it in a secret compartment in the desk. He exits the room in slow-motion. 
Fade to Black. 
EXT. Ari’s house - night, present day
ARI opens the back of his work van. We see him from inside the van. He looks around to make sure he’s alone. He climbs into the back of the van. He fumbles through some junk. He pauses. We hear him dragging something large out of the van. He heaves the heavy spacesuit off the ledge. He jumps down, and drags it clumsily through the door of the house. 
EXT. BROOKLYN INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT, 2001
DJINN walks down the middle of the street. Lamps light the edges of the road. He holds his backpack straps with each hand. An industrial rave club blasts music as neon light seeps out the unmarked door. DJINN turns the corner of a dimly lit alley. He speeds up the pace. He climbs the ladder to the roof of a warehouse. On the roof is a billboard for Splendor cigarettes. He pulls a black spray-can from his backpack. He scrawls his tag on the billboard, and runs off, back down the ladder, down the alley.)
INT. ARI’S HOUSE - NIGHT, Present Day
ARI sits on his couch. He stares at the spacesuit leaned up against his 90’s wooden entertainment center. He scratches and rubs his head and face. He lights a joint and puts on a record. He contemplates the spacesuit.
INT. FRENCH CATACOMBS - NIGHT, 2001
JAMES lights a torch. He travels along a wall of graffiti. He turns left. He continues to the end and turns right. He continues, until he finds an alcove room. He enters. He looks along the wall at the graffiti. He pauses in the center, and pulls back his light for a larger scope. It’s a giant fresco. In the fresco a spaceman stands in the middle of a grove of trees. He gasps. He takes a picture on a polaroid, and quickly leaves the room. 
EXT. BROOKLYN - NIGHT, 2001
DJINN is walking down the main street of the Industrial Park. We see the billboard behind him of the man smoking a Splendor cigarette. He gets far enough away, and utters the words:
DJINN
I summon you…
The tag on the billboard ignites. It begins burning a hole through the billboard; it ripples into tattered flames. DJINN is now outside the nightclub. Suddenly, a woman spills out of the door and onto the street. 
Bouncer
Have a good night. 
Ary
Yeah, sure. Whatever—
DJINN wanders over to her to check and make sure she’s okay. 
DJINN
Hey, are you al—
Ary
I’m okay, I’m okay. Hey, I said I’m fine, okay?
(ARY lights a cigarette. )
DJINN
Ok, my bad. 
ARY
No, you’re fine. 
(She double takes at him, looking him up and down. )
ARY
OH, oh my, you ARE fine. What’s your name?
Djinn
Uh, Djinn, but look I gotta go-
Ary
Wait, your name’s Djinn?? like a genie. 
Djinn
Yeah, but look, I gotta go. 
Ary
Oh, alright. Yeah, sure. 
Djinn
I’ll— probably see you here again though. 
Ary
Oh, yaya. I’m here all the time. 
DJINN goes to walk away. ARY runs back up to him.
Here, here just take my number. 
DJINN
Look- ah shit, alright. 
She writes her number on a piece of paper and hands it to him. 
Ary
See ya later, Djinn. 
Djinn
For sure. I’ll see you. 
He walks away into the dark
ARY takes a sucker out of her purse and pops it in her mouth. 
Int. nyc Skyscraper - Night
We see R adjusting his watch. He walks around his office desk. We hear heavy animalistic breathing. 
R
The time is coming. We must make ourselves invaluable to the age that is within. 
(Breathing continues)
How is the planetary exploration coming brother?
Deep voice
It is going well. we have 3 possible colony targets in our sights. 
R
Yes. And all habitable I trust?
DEEP VOICE
Yes. And no. 
R
(Beat.)
What do you mean?
Deep VOICE
Two are habitable for me. Only one is habitable for you. 
R
. . . I see. Well we must even more so ensure our survival then. 
He taps his fingers on the desk and presses a button to end the call. Beat. 
He stares out the large plate glass window at the night skyline. We see the alien god sparkle in his eye. 
INT. ARI’S HOUSE - NIGHT, PRESENT DAY
ARI is wearing the spacesuit as he sits on his couch. He smokes a cigarette.
ARI
Man. This is so cool.
He makes poses in the suit. 
ARI
Man, I wonder if there’s any space shit still in this thing—
He begins to ravage the suit pockets and zippers looking for anything interesting. 
EXT.  JAMES HOUSE - New orleans - NIGHT, PRESENT
JAMES walks up to his backdoor. He pulls his keys out of his pocket. He looks around to make sure nobody is around. He flips through his keys, landing on an old worn brass key. He sticks it into the door. 
He opens the door. He walks through to an ancient grove in the forest. 
He turns around and locks the door behind him. He hangs his hat on a tree branch and shovels off down the path towards the Orchard… 
INT. ARI’S HOUSE - NIGHT, PRESENT DAY
ARI holds the item in his hand. He flips it to the bottom. He rolls it around in his hand.  Suddenly the door opens. In walks ARI’s friend PRINCE carrying a bag a food. 
Prince
Yo, woaaah! Where’d you get that?
Ari
It was in some old lady’s junk. 
Prince
That’s the best costume I’ve ever seen anybody throw away.
Ari
Yeah, no lie, it’s pretty cool.
Prince
You smoke in it?
Ari
What?? I mean… not yet. 
Prince
Aaaaahhh. Hahaha. Let’s roll one, son!
Music montage
ARI and PRINCE get stoned and play around with the spacesuit. 
PRINCE is passed out in the Lay-Z-Boy. 
ARI sits by himself in the spacesuit on the couch. He listens to the music playing and leans back. He starts to drift off to sleep. 
He has a dream he is taking off in a space launch. He is strapped to a seat and listening to the countdown. When the voice reaches 0, he strains his face as the rocket launches. He blasts off further and further from Earth. He screams—
Ext. The Orchard
Suddenly, he is falling through the sky about 30 feet above the Orchard. He falls through the roof of the Villa and lands on a chaise lounge. 
He grunts in pain. He tries to get up and have a look around, but falls back to a landing pose.
JAMES is standing in the doorway of the villa. He is sipping tea. 
JAMES
I thought you might be dropping by. 
ARI looks surprised and confused. 
ARI
What planet am I on?
JAMES
This is not a planet, it’s a parcel of spacetime I have acquired and it exists somewhere between dream and reality. 
Ari
What about the launch? I went to space-
James
That- was just a dream. 
(Beat)
Ari
So… this is…
James
This is The Orchard. My name is James. 
Ari
Uh huh. And I just…
James
You teleported here while wearing the suit. You see?
Ari
I teleported? To…
James
A parcel of spacetime I have come to occupy known as The Orchard, yes. Now do relax. 
Ari
I knew there was some kind of spooky juju with this suit—
James
Well, yes, but we haven’t got to that part. Come. I’ll explain everything in the Theater.
Ari
In the what? 
JAMES begins to walk away, stirring his tea. ARI shovels to his feet and follows behind. 
Int. Movie theater - The Orchard
JAMES ushers ARI through the doorway of the theater. He shows him the row.
James
Please. Have a seat. 
ARI sits down. The lights lower. 
A film begins. ARI watches the film intently. We watch him watching the film and still shots around the theatre. We hear sounds of old 1950’s scifi movies. We see a clip of James, sitting in the Orchard. A very Star Trek esque portal opens and in walks a man who looks similar to ARI, dressed in a spacesuit. The spaceman takes off his helmet. 
SPACEMAN
Hello. I am from Earth. I was sent on my mission and ended up here. What is this place?
James
This … is the Orchard. A small plot of spacetime I have come to acquire. 
Spaceman
So it is… Then I have found what I was looking for. 
James
Yes. Welcome. I had been awaiting your arrival. 
We watch ARI watching the old film in amazement and scrutiny. We see both the Spaceman and JAMES on screen together:
Both
I need your help!
ARI proceeds to watch the rest of the movie. We hear the sound effects. He even had a bag of popcorn at one point. We see on screen the Spaceman and James are on Earth. They are in NYC. A teenage boy sits on a stoop dribbling a basketball. We see several creepy “red” men in the shadows. The boy begins to get nervous. He dribbles fast and faster. Suddenly we see the Spaceman and James notice he’s in trouble. They rush into the scene. James has a magic pistol. The Spaceman has a ray gun. They exchange gun battle with the strange bad men. They save the day, and lift the boy up on their shoulders. The three are then on a roof of a building in NYC watching the sunset. We see a “THE END” and “More Great Adventures Coming Soon”. 
The lights click on in the theater. JAMES slowly walks down the aisle. ARI stands up and stretches. 
Ari
So- this is a dream, right? I will eventually wake up. I’m just in a coma or something. 
James
This is an alternate reality. A parcel of spacetime-
Ari
That you have come to acquire, yeah you told me that. So what, you made a movie with a guy that looked like me, so what?
James
That film was made by the French filmmaker Rene Benoît in 1939. He made 16 films in the series he called “La Noblesse Étrange” or “The Weird Nobility”. The film was a notable work of history for it’s cast of mostly African descent. 
Ari
Huh. Okay. Cool. So what?
James
So- every member of the cast went missing after the series ended. 
Ari
Huh… and you- wait.
James
I was gifted a key. Which unlocks a portal from Earth to here. And I come and go as I please. 
Ari
You look the same as you did in 1939… How- how is that possible?
James
This place has special relativity. A person ages 1/100th the speed they do on Earth. 
Ari
That’s insane… So, why am I here? 
(Beat)
James
You still think this is a dream, don’t you?
Ari
Oh, absolutely.
James
Do you still have the object?
Ari
The object…? Oh, you mean this.
He pulls the tiny gyroscope out of his pocket. 
I found this earlier in the suit. It’s some kind of toy?
James
May I?
He holds out his hand as ARI gives him the gyroscope. 
James
It is a toy, of sorts. It’s maybe what you’d call an early simulator. Meant to describe the gravity of our solar system.
