<br>FADE IN:
<br>INT. James’ attic - day, 1925
<br>JAMES sits at the desk writing a note.  Snow falls outside the window. He writes:
        <br>The Orchard,                                  
        <br>Where We Are Gods,                          
        <br>Exists Because                        
        <br>We Say It So Exists.                     
              <br>— The Weird Nobility
<br>He slams the quill on the desk, folds the letter, and sticks it in an envelope. He seals the letter with a wax seal. He puts it in a secret compartment in the desk. He exits the room in slow-motion. 
<br>Fade to Black. 
<br>EXT. Ari’s house - night, present day
<br>ARI opens the back of his work van. We see him from inside the van. He looks around to make sure he’s alone. He climbs into the back of the van. He fumbles through some junk. He pauses. We hear him dragging something large out of the van. He heaves the heavy spacesuit off the ledge. He jumps down, and drags it clumsily through the door of the house. 
<br>EXT. BROOKLYN INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT, 2001
<br>DJINN walks down the middle of the street. Lamps light the edges of the road. He holds his backpack straps with each hand. An industrial rave club blasts music as neon light seeps out the unmarked door. DJINN turns the corner of a dimly lit alley. He speeds up the pace. He climbs the ladder to the roof of a warehouse. On the roof is a billboard for Splendor cigarettes. He pulls a black spray-can from his backpack. He scrawls his tag on the billboard, and runs off, back down the ladder, down the alley.)
<br>INT. ARI’S HOUSE - NIGHT, Present Day
<br>ARI sits on his couch. He stares at the spacesuit leaned up against his 90’s wooden entertainment center. He scratches and rubs his head and face. He lights a joint and puts on a record. He contemplates the spacesuit.
<br>INT. FRENCH CATACOMBS - NIGHT, 2001
<br>JAMES lights a torch. He travels along a wall of graffiti. He turns left. He continues to the end and turns right. He continues, until he finds an alcove room. He enters. He looks along the wall at the graffiti. He pauses in the center, and pulls back his light for a larger scope. It’s a giant fresco. In the fresco a spaceman stands in the middle of a grove of trees. He gasps. He takes a picture on a polaroid, and quickly leaves the room. 
<br>EXT. BROOKLYN - NIGHT, 2001
<br>DJINN is walking down the main street of the Industrial Park. We see the billboard behind him of the man smoking a Splendor cigarette. He gets far enough away, and utters the words:
<br>DJINN
<br>I summon you…
<br>The tag on the billboard ignites. It begins burning a hole through the billboard; it ripples into tattered flames. DJINN is now outside the nightclub. Suddenly, a woman spills out of the door and onto the street. 
<br>BOUNCER
<br>Have a good night. 
<br>ARY
<br>Yeah, sure. Whatever—
<br>DJINN wanders over to her to check and make sure she’s okay. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Hey, are you al—
<br>ARY
<br>I’m okay, I’m okay. Hey, I said I’m fine, okay?
<br>(ARY lights a cigarette. )
<br>DJINN
<br>Ok, my bad. 
<br>ARY
<br>No, you’re fine. 
<br>(She double takes at him, looking him up and down. )
<br>ARY
<br>OH, oh my, you ARE fine. What’s your name?
<br>DJINN
<br>Uh, Djinn, but look I gotta go-
<br>ARY
<br>Wait, your name’s Djinn?? like a genie. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Yeah, but look, I gotta go. 
<br>ARY
<br>Oh, alright. Yeah, sure. 
<br>DJINN
<br>I’ll— probably see you here again though. 
<br>ARY
<br>Oh, yaya. I’m here all the time. 
<br>DJINN goes to walk away. ARY runs back up to him.
<br>Here, here just take my number. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Look- ah shit, alright. 
<br>She writes her number on a piece of paper and hands it to him. 
<br>ARY
<br>See ya later, Djinn. 
<br>DJINN
<br>For sure. I’ll see you. 
<br>He walks away into the dark
<br>ARY takes a sucker out of her purse and pops it in her mouth. 
INT. NYC SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT
<br>We see R adjusting his watch. He walks around his office desk. We hear heavy animalistic breathing. 
<br>R
<br>The time is coming. We must make ourselves invaluable to the age that is within. 
<br>(Breathing continues)
<br>How is the planetary exploration coming brother?
<br>DEEP VOICE
<br>It is going well. we have 3 possible colony targets in our sights. 
<br>R
<br>Yes. And all habitable I trust?
<br>DEEP VOICE
<br>Yes. And no. 
<br>R
<br>(Beat.)
<br>What do you mean?
<br>DEEP VOICE
<br>Two are habitable for me. Only one is habitable for you. 
<br>R
<br>. . . I see. Well we must even more so ensure our survival then. 
<br>He taps his fingers on the desk and presses a button to end the call. Beat. 
<br>He stares out the large plate glass window at the night skyline. We see the alien god sparkle in his eye. 
<br>INT. ARI’S HOUSE - NIGHT, PRESENT DAY
<br>ARI is wearing the spacesuit as he sits on his couch. He smokes a cigarette.
<br>ARI
<br>Man. This is so cool.
<br>He makes poses in the suit. 
<br>ARI
<br>Man, I wonder if there’s any space shit still in this thing—
<br>He begins to ravage the suit pockets and zippers looking for anything interesting. 
<br>EXT.  JAMES HOUSE - New orleans - NIGHT, PRESENT
<br>JAMES walks up to his backdoor. He pulls his keys out of his pocket. He looks around to make sure nobody is around. He flips through his keys, landing on an old worn brass key. He sticks it into the door. 
<br>He opens the door. He walks through to an ancient grove in the forest. 
<br>He turns around and locks the door behind him. He hangs his hat on a tree branch and shovels off down the path towards the Orchard… 
<br>INT. ARI’S HOUSE - NIGHT, PRESENT DAY
<br>ARI holds the item in his hand. He flips it to the bottom. He rolls it around in his hand.  Suddenly the door opens. In walks ARI’s friend PRINCE carrying a bag a food. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>Yo, woaaah! Where’d you get that?
<br>ARI
<br>It was in some old lady’s junk. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>That’s the best costume I’ve ever seen anybody throw away.
<br>ARI
<br>Yeah, no lie, it’s pretty cool.
<br>PRINCE
<br>You smoke in it?
<br>ARI
<br>What?? I mean… not yet. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>Aaaaahhh. Hahaha. Let’s roll one, son!
<br>Music montage
<br>ARI and PRINCE get stoned and play around with the spacesuit. 
<br>PRINCE is passed out in the Lay-Z-Boy. 
<br>ARI sits by himself in the spacesuit on the couch. He listens to the music playing and leans back. He starts to drift off to sleep. 
<br>He has a dream he is taking off in a space launch. He is strapped to a seat and listening to the countdown. When the voice reaches 0, he strains his face as the rocket launches. He blasts off further and further from Earth. He screams—
<br>EXT. THE ORCHARD - DAY
<br>Suddenly, he is falling through the sky about 30 feet above the Orchard. He falls through the roof of the Villa and lands on a chaise lounge. 
<br>He grunts in pain. He tries to get up and have a look around, but falls back to a landing pose.
<br>JAMES is standing in the doorway of the villa. He is sipping tea. 
<br>JAMES
<br>I thought you might be dropping by. 
<br>ARI looks surprised and confused. 
<br>ARI
<br>What planet am I on?
<br>JAMES
<br>This is not a planet, it’s a parcel of spacetime I have acquired and it exists somewhere between dream and reality. 
<br>ARI
<br>What about the launch? I went to space-
<br>JAMES
<br>That- was just a dream. 
<br>(Beat)
<br>ARI
<br>So… this is…
<br>JAMES
<br>This is The Orchard. My name is James. 
<br>ARI
<br>Uh huh. And I just…
<br>JAMES
<br>You teleported here while wearing the suit. You see?
<br>ARI
<br>I teleported? To…
<br>JAMES
<br>A parcel of spacetime I have come to occupy known as The Orchard, yes. Now do relax. 
<br>ARI
<br>I knew there was some kind of spooky juju with this suit—
<br>JAMES
<br>Well, yes, but we haven’t got to that part. Come. I’ll explain everything in the Theater.
<br>ARI
<br>In the what? 
<br>JAMES begins to walk away, stirring his tea. ARI shovels to his feet and follows behind. 
<br>INT. MOVIE THEATER - THE ORCHARD
<br>JAMES ushers ARI through the doorway of the theater. He shows him the row.
<br>JAMES
<br>Please. Have a seat. 
<br>ARI sits down. The lights lower. 
<br>A film begins. ARI watches the film intently. We watch him watching the film and still shots around the theatre. We hear sounds of old 1950’s scifi movies. We see a clip of James, sitting in the Orchard. A very Star Trek esque portal opens and in walks a man who looks similar to ARI, dressed in a spacesuit. The spaceman takes off his helmet. 
<br>SPACEMAN
<br>Hello. I am from Earth. I was sent on my mission and ended up here. What is this place?
<br>JAMES
<br>This … is the Orchard. A small plot of spacetime I have come to acquire. 
<br>SPACEMAN
<br>So it is… Then I have found what I was looking for. 
<br>JAMES
<br>Yes. Welcome. I had been awaiting your arrival. 
<br>We watch ARI watching the old film in amazement and scrutiny. We see both the Spaceman and JAMES on screen together:
<br>BOTH
<br>I need your help!
<br>ARI proceeds to watch the rest of the movie. We hear the sound effects. He even had a bag of popcorn at one point. We see on screen the Spaceman and James are on Earth. They are in NYC. A teenage boy sits on a stoop dribbling a basketball. We see several creepy “red” men in the shadows. The boy begins to get nervous. He dribbles fast and faster. Suddenly we see the Spaceman and James notice he’s in trouble. They rush into the scene. James has a magic pistol. The Spaceman has a ray gun. They exchange gun battle with the strange bad men. They save the day, and lift the boy up on their shoulders. The three are then on a roof of a building in NYC watching the sunset. We see a “THE END” and “More Great Adventures Coming Soon”. 
<br>The lights click on in the theater. JAMES slowly walks down the aisle. ARI stands up and stretches. 
<br>ARI
<br>So- this is a dream, right? I will eventually wake up. I’m just in a coma or something. 
<br>JAMES
<br>This is an alternate reality. A parcel of spacetime-
<br>ARI
<br>That you have come to acquire, yeah you told me that. So what, you made a movie with a guy that looked like me, so what?
<br>JAMES
<br>That film was made by the French filmmaker Rene Benoît in 1939. He made 16 films in the series he called “La Noblesse Étrange” or “The Weird Nobility”. The film was a notable work of history for it’s cast of mostly African descent. 
<br>ARI
<br>Huh. Okay. Cool. So what?
<br>JAMES
<br>So- every member of the cast went missing after the series ended. 
<br>ARI
<br>Huh… and you- wait.
<br>JAMES
<br>I was gifted a key. Which unlocks a portal from Earth to here. And I come and go as I please. 
<br>ARI
<br>You look the same as you did in 1939… How- how is that possible?
<br>JAMES
<br>This place has special relativity. A person ages 1/100th the speed they do on Earth. 
<br>ARI
<br>That’s insane… So, why am I here? 
<br>(Beat)
<br>JAMES
<br>You still think this is a dream, don’t you?
<br>ARI
<br>Oh, absolutely.
<br>JAMES
<br>Do you still have the object?
<br>ARI
<br>The object…? Oh, you mean this.
<br>He pulls the tiny gyroscope out of his pocket. 
<br>I found this earlier in the suit. It’s some kind of toy?
<br>JAMES
<br>May I?
<br>He holds out his hand as ARI gives him the gyroscope. 
<br>JAMES
<br>It is a toy, of sorts. It’s maybe what you’d call an early simulator. Meant to describe the gravity of our solar system.
<br>JAMES takes the toy.
<br>Come. It’s time to send you back. 
<br>They stand up and walk out of the theater. 
<br>EXT. - THE ORCHARD - DAY
<br>They walk out the door of the Villa to the rows of apple trees. They stop in a small clearing. 
<br>JAMES
<br>This object is a vessel. Much like the suit. 
<br>He give the toy a few turns. It begins turning on it’s own, and soon begins spinning autonomously. JAMES balances the toy in his hand. It begins floating in midair. ARI looks on in complete shock. 
<br>JAMES 
<br>You must clearly set the destination in your mind. Then, you just hold on. 
<br>ARI 
<br>Wait, that little thing is a spaceship??
<br>JAMES
<br>Precisely!
<br>Now, imagine you’re home, sitting on your couch. And when your ready, grab the device. Ok?
<br>ARI nods his head. He closes his eyes. He reaches out and takes the toy. 
<br>HE is thrust through a wormhole. He clings onto the tot as his face strains. Colorful galaxies pass by in a flash. 
<br>CUT TO BLACK
<br>He slowly opens his eyes. He’s back in his living room. He looks at his arms and legs. The toy is still in his hand. He quickly puts it in a pocket of the suit and zips it up. Prince is still asleep on the chair. He gets up and goes to his bedroom, patting Prince on the way. Prince makes a noise and then falls back asleep. 
<br>INT. - BROOKLYN (2001) - Djinn’s apt - the next day
<br>DJINN wakes up in his bed. There’s a knock at the door. He groans. He gets up and goes to the door of his apartment. 
<br>He opens the door. ARY is in the doorway. She leans in the doorframe. 
<br>ARY
<br>Thought I might find you here. 
<br>DJINN chuckles. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Hey. 
<br>ARY
<br>Hey.
<br>DJINN
<br>You wanna come in?
<br>ARY
<br>Well, duh. 
<br>He gestures and she enters the apartment. 
<br>He closes the door behind her. 
<br>DJINN
<br>So (sternly and half-joking) how’d you find me and what do you want?
<br>ARY
<br>I looked your number up on Google. Gave me your address. 
<br>DJINN
<br>You looked me up on… The magic of the Internet. 
<br>ARY
<br>Uh-huh. (She smiles)
<br>DJINN
<br>So… what do you want.
<br>ARY
<br>I wanna be friends. 
<br>DJINN crosses his arms and grins. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Friends. Ok. Yeah, we can be friends. 
<br>ARY
<br>Good. I want you to know, I’m really good. Like, I won’t get you into trouble. And I won’t come on to you. I’ll try not to.
<br>DJINN
<br>Hmm. Seems fair enough. To what do I owe your acquaintance then?
<br>ARY
<br>Ugh! Now what would you owe me, honey? I want to celebrate you! My treat.
<br>DJINN
<br>Celebrate me? You don’t know me yet. 
<br>ARY
<br>Well… I see good intent. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Mm. (He smiles)
<br>ARY
<br>I know a place you might like.
<br>DJINN raises an eyebrow. 
<br>Int. - The speakeasy - noon
<br>Hard cut to DJINN and ARY having lunch at a very quiet speakeasy restaurant. There’s a single exotic dancer in the middle of the dining area. Electric groove music plays. 
<br>DJINN takes a sip of champagne.
<br>DJINN
<br>You were so right. (Swallowing)
<br>ARY
<br>See? 
<br>DJINN
<br>(Leaning in whispering)
<br>We can absolutely be friends.
<br>ARY
<br>Mmhmm. 
<br>They both chuckle together. 
<br>The camera spin-pans out from the restaurant.
<br>INT. - R’s penthouse suite - noon - 2001
<br>R sits on a couch. A woman cooks for him in the kitchen. He is listening to ambient techno music. He is dressed in black Adidas leisure wear. 
<br>She finishes and brings him a plate. She has dirty blonde hair, and wears a t-shirt and shorts. 
<br>R
<br>Thank you, darling. 
<br>MAYA
<br>No problem, dear.
<br>R
<br>Mm, the greens are delicious. 
<br>MAYA
<br>So glad you like them.
<br>R
<br>When … everything goes off … I want to grow greens like these. On our new home. 
<br>MAYA
<br>Our new home. (She smiles)
<br>R
<br>Which, btw, may be less appealing than I’d hoped. 
<br>MAYA
<br>Oh? How so?
<br>R
<br>Well- we may be stuck inside a bubble, more or less. Our friend says habitable search hasn’t returned a good result. 
<br>MAYA
<br>Mm, I see. Well darling, there’s still time. Don’t lose hope. 
<br>R
<br>In the meantime I’m meeting with some companies about the situation. I only want the best for us. 
<br>MAYA
<br>(She rubs his chest) I know you’ll make us a good home, baby. And for him too?
<br>R
<br>It’s already habitable for him, and… the rest of them. Allegedly. 
<br>MAYA
<br>Oh, well, even better. (She inhales) You need your army. 
<br>R
<br>Mm, right. Yes. Well, after I see our options hopefully we can cut the deal. 
<br>MAYA
<br>That’s my baby.
<br>She smiles. Her eyes go dark and we can see the alien god twinkle in her eye. 
<br>INT. - Wearhouse - upstate - day - present
<br>Close-up: ARI is welding a car frame at the shop he works at. 
<br>PRINCE walks out of the office sipping coffee. He walks over towards ARI. He waves and shouts to get his attention. 
<br>ARI puts down the welder. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>Man, let’s get lunch. I’m starving. 
<br>ARI
<br>Shit. Yeah, let’s go. 
<br>Hard cut: ARI and PRINCE are walking down the sidewalk. PRINCE pulls out a joint and lights it. We see a flash cut of ARI wearing the suit.
<br>PRINCE
<br>Aw shit. (Inhaling) You want some?
<br>ARI
<br>Nah, I gotta finish welding. You enjoy. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>Man, this desk life is nice. You should get on it. 
<br>ARI
<br>Nah, man. I like working with my hands. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>And you are good as hell. 
<br>ARI
<br>Just ready to get home and blast off. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>Man, I hear that. Sure you don’t want any?
<br>ARI
<br>No, man. I mean in that suit. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>In the suit? The spacesuit?
<br>ARI
<br>Yeah!
<br>PRINCE
<br>I mean it is pretty swag, but—
<br>ARI
<br>No man, listen. After we smoked last night I fell asleep. And I had a dream I blasted into space. And fell through this roof. And- anyway. Look it’s whatever, man, you don’t have to believe me. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>Not believe you? Why wouldn’t I believe you? Sounds rad as shit man. I wish I could have a dream like that.
<br>ARI
<br>Yeah. Yeah, I wanna try it again. 
<br>PRINCE
<br>(Laughing) Shit man! Do it! Let me know how it goes. Hey, I got a friend who sells DMT if you ever wanna really go to space. 
<br>ARI
<br>What?
<br>PRINCE laughs hysterically, then throws an arm over ARI’s shoulder. They walk down the road into the sun as the focus blurs behind them. 
<br>Ext. - The Orchard - NIgHt
<br>JAMES walks out of the villa archway towards the row of trees. The takes out a key and sticks it into what appears to be nothing. He turns an invisible handle. A doorway shape opens. He pushes his way through. 
<br>Ext.  - BROOKLYN - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY
<br>JAMES walks out into the alley in Brooklyn. He walks out to the street as a young crowd walks by for a night out. He makes a right turn and walks down the street. 
<br>DJINN and ARY are walking down a friendly well lit street near Prospect Park. There are market lights above them. 
<br>DJINN
<br>I had a really nice time today. 
<br>ARY
<br>Really? Me too! 
<br>DJINN
<br>Yeah. And I want to see you again. 
<br>ARY
<br>Ok! I would love to, you know, do it too!
<br>DJINN
<br>That’s great. Perfect. Stellar. 
<br>ARY
<br>(Laughs) Haha you are so poetic. 
<br>They both laugh full heartedly. 
<br>JAMES sees them from down the street. He checks his watch. He moves closer to them. 
<br>ARY
<br>Okay, well. This is my place. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Okay, well. Have a great rest of your night. 
<br>ARY
<br>Yeah. Yeah you too. 
<br>They look at each other longingly. ARY excitedly gives him a big kiss on the lips. Then she turns and runs up the stairs giggling. DJINN starts to chuckle.
<br>DJINN
<br>Hey!
<br>She waves goodbye and closes the door. DJINN touches his lips. We see him standing in front of the apartment. JAMES walks up stands next to him. They both look at the door together. DJINN suddenly notices him but doesn’t seem to care. Then he does a double take. 
<br>DJINN
<br>Can I help you?
<br>JAMES
<br>Well I hope so. 
<br>(Pause)
<br>DJINN
<br>What can I do for you?
<br>JAMES
<br>I need to use your talent to save the world from a destructive force unlike man has ever seen. 
<br>DJINN
<br>(Pauses) Who are you?
<br>JAMES
<br>I am James. 
<br>DJINN
<br>James who?
<br>JAMES
<br>Now that is a long story. Would you care to take a walk? It sure is a beautiful night. 
<br>DJINN thinks about it. He looks at the door. 
<br>DJINN
<br>This had better be good … crazy old man…
<br>
<br>EXT.  BROOKLYN - 2001 - NIGHT
<br>DJINN and JAMES walk down the sidewalk. 
<br>James
<br>So you like this girl? The one you walked home?
<br>Djinn
<br>Yes, I do.
<br>James
<br>And you want to marry her someday?
<br>Djinn
<br>Well, that’s a big step, but—
<br>James
<br>But you want the ability to. Someday. 
<br>Djinn
<br>I mean … yeah, okay. So how is this world end ending my man? Nuclear apocalypse? Alien invasion? Climate disaster?
<br>James
<br>Yes. All three, actually. (Beat) Would you like to have a cup of tea?
<br>Djinn
<br>I wouldn’t mind a cup.
<br>James walks a little ahead of him to an unlit area of the Park. He pulls out his key from his pocket and inserts it into thin air. He turns the key and opens a door.
<br>A well lit Paris street in bright daylight is before them. James walks through, followed by a bewildered Djinn. James closes the door behind them. 
<br>They appear in front of cute tea shop. 
<br>EXT. TEA SHOP - PARIS - DAY
<br>JAMES gestures to the tea shop. DJINN looks around still bewildered. 
<br>Djinn
<br>What. In. The. Hell. 
<br>They enter the Tea Shop. They are greeted by a beautiful hostess. 
<br>Hostess
<br>Bon jour. Combien de personnes?
<br>James
<br>Trois. 
<br>Hostess
<br>Trés bien. 
<br>The HOSTESS gestures to follow. 
<br>James
<br>Après vous.
<br>He puts a hand out gesturing to DJINN. DJINN gleefully follows the beautiful hostess. 
<br>They walk back into the tea shop, through several textile doorways. 
<br>She shows them to a booth under dim lighting. There are candles lit around the room and on the table. 
<br>James
<br>Merci beaucoup. 
<br>She smiles. They both sit down in the booth on opposite sides of each other. 
<br>Djinn
<br>So, who’s the third person?
<br>James
<br>No one. I wanted to ensure we got the larger table specifically in the back. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Right. So how the fuck did you just open a door to Paris from Brooklyn Heights? 
<br>James
<br>I have a special key, gifted to me by… well, let’s say I crafted it. 
<br>Djinn
<br>You crafted it? What are you a blacksmith?
<br>James
<br>It was passed down to me by someone. 
<br>Djinn
<br>By who? You’re granddad or something?
<br>James
<br>No, not a relative. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Okay. So… a god?
<br>James
<br>Oh no, not like that. I received it from a past me. A past life. 
<br>Djinn
<br>What? How is that possible?
<br>James
<br>I knew I would I would need it in this present. And I left myself a map.
<br>Djinn
<br>(Understanding) I see. Well grandpa- mind if I call you grandpa? So what do you know about the end of the world? You brought me all the way to France, you must really be desperate. 
<br>James
<br>I need you. And you specifically. I hear you have a gift. Something in your writing? You can conjure a demon?
<br>Djinn
<br>Not a demon. … I can summon fire. 
<br>James
<br>Mm, I see. And this fire manifests as…
<br>Djinn
<br>I just tell it what I want and it…
<br>James
<br>It just- it burns?
<br>Djinn
<br>Yeah. But it’s also more than that. Like- here.
<br>DJINN looks intently at the fire. He makes a small gesture with his hand. The flame grows larger and more chaotic. He stops making the gesture and the flame dies down. 
<br>JAMES smiles politely. 
<br>James
<br>That’s wonderful. You can control fire. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Look, I told you, it’s more complicated than that-
<br>James
<br>Complicated how?
<br>Djinn
<br>It’s a relationship. I am good to it, it’s good to me. I consider myself blessed by God with a gift. 
<br>James
<br>And you are. As are all believers in a higher power. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Yeah… but- it’s hard to control sometimes. And sometimes it doesn’t work at all. 
<br>James
<br>I see. Well, just need to work on it is all. I think I know someone who can help you. Teach you ways of understanding your gift. This may lead you to being able to as you say control it. If that’s what you need. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Hey, I didn’t say I need anything. We got a good thing right now. I have a good thing right now. 
<br>James
<br>Of course. But if we don’t act, you may not have anything to call yours at all. 
<br>DJINN considers speaking, but thinks there may be something true to JAMES’ words. 
<br>James
<br>Okay. So we have to save the world from… 
<br>James
<br>Total and utter destruction. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Right. So. Who do you have in mind. 
<br>Just then, a skinny man in exotic attire, jewelry, and symbolic tattoos enters the room. 
<br>James
<br>Ah, just in time.
<br>Djinn
<br>Man, I thought you said there was no third?
<br>James
<br>(Shrugging) I lied.
<br>DJINN shakes his head. 
<br>Djinn
<br>Okay. Let’s talk then. 
<br>Int.  UPSTATE BAR - NIGHT
<br>ARI is drinking at a quiet bar in Upstate New York. PRINCE enters from outside and takes a seat next to him.
